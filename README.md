# Tutorial
Built as I walked thru Git's Hello-World tutoral
#
#
Lines 1 and 2 were automatic, it seems.  I think line2 is the description i gave for the repository (for which the name is in line 1). 
#
This is my second go-round with the branch steps of the tutorial.  Even though I successfully created a branch yesterday, I found them confusing and possible contain an error.  Hopefully, this second attempt will go more smoothly.
